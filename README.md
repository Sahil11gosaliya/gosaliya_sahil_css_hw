TO DO list hw


This document follows the content of the given project.


The following task is about creating a to do list and giving
it a styling using css.

Making a checklist for a project is main idea for the task as
it is showing changes on button for before and after clciking.

Therefore, my idea of choosing the novel writing as a to do list 
is an appropriate thing to display as there are various steps available.

To dos, in progress and done are the main part of this task.
